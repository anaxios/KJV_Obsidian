 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Furthermore Elihu answered and said, ^1
 2. Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. ^2
 3. For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. ^3
 4. Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good. ^4
 5. For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. ^5
 6. Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. ^6
 7. What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? ^7
 8. Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. ^8
 9. For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. ^9
 10. Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. ^10
 11. For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. ^11
 12. Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. ^12
 13. Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? ^13
 14. If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; ^14
 15. All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. ^15
 16. If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. ^16
 17. Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? ^17
 18. Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? ^18
 19. How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. ^19
 20. In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. ^20
 21. For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. ^21
 22. There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. ^22
 23. For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. ^23
 24. He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. ^24
 25. Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. ^25
 26. He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; ^26
 27. Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: ^27
 28. So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. ^28
 29. When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: ^29
 30. That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. ^30
 31. Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: ^31
 32. That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. ^32
 33. Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. ^33
 34. Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. ^34
 35. Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. ^35
 36. My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. ^36
 37. For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God. ^37
