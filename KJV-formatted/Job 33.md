 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. ^1
 2. Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. ^2
 3. My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. ^3
 4. The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. ^4
 5. If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up. ^5
 6. Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. ^6
 7. Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. ^7
 8. Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, ^8
 9. I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. ^9
 10. Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, ^10
 11. He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. ^11
 12. Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. ^12
 13. Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. ^13
 14. For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. ^14
 15. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; ^15
 16. Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, ^16
 17. That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. ^17
 18. He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. ^18
 19. He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: ^19
 20. So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. ^20
 21. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. ^21
 22. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. ^22
 23. If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: ^23
 24. Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. ^24
 25. His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: ^25
 26. He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. ^26
 27. He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; ^27
 28. He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. ^28
 29. Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, ^29
 30. To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. ^30
 31. Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. ^31
 32. If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. ^32
 33. If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. ^33
