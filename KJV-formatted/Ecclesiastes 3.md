 Book:: [[Ecclesiastes]]
 1. To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: ^1
 2. A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; ^2
 3. A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; ^3
 4. A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; ^4
 5. A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; ^5
 6. A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; ^6
 7. A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; ^7
 8. A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. ^8
 9. What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? ^9
 10. I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. ^10
 11. He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. ^11
 12. I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. ^12
 13. And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God. ^13
 14. I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. ^14
 15. That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. ^15
 16. And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there. ^16
 17. I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. ^17
 18. I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. ^18
 19. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. ^19
 20. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. ^20
 21. Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? ^21
 22. Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? ^22
