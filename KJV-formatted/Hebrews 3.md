 Book:: [[Hebrews]]
 1. Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; ^1
 2. Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. ^2
 3. For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. ^3
 4. For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God. ^4
 5. And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; ^5
 6. But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. ^6
 7. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, ^7
 8. Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: ^8
 9. When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. ^9
 10. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. ^10
 11. So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) ^11
 12. Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. ^12
 13. But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. ^13
 14. For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; ^14
 15. While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. ^15
 16. For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. ^16
 17. But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? ^17
 18. And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? ^18
 19. So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. ^19
