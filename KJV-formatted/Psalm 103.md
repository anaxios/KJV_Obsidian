 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. ^1
 2. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: ^2
 3. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; ^3
 4. Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; ^4
 5. Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. ^5
 6. The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. ^6
 7. He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. ^7
 8. The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. ^8
 9. He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. ^9
 10. He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. ^10
 11. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. ^11
 12. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. ^12
 13. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. ^13
 14. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. ^14
 15. As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. ^15
 16. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. ^16
 17. But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children; ^17
 18. To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. ^18
 19. The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. ^19
 20. Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. ^20
 21. Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. ^21
 22. Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul. ^22
