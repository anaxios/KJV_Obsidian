 2. The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people. ^2
 3. Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. ^3
 4. The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. ^4
 5. Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. ^5
 6. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. ^6
 7. He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. ^7
 8. Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. ^8
 9. Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy. ^9
