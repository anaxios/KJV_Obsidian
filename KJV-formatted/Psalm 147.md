 2. The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. ^2
 3. He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. ^3
 4. He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. ^4
 5. Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite. ^5
 6. The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. ^6
 7. Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: ^7
 8. Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. ^8
 9. He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry. ^9
 10. He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. ^10
 11. The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. ^11
 12. Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. ^12

 15. He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly. ^15
 16. He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. ^16
 17. He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? ^17
 18. He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. ^18
 19. He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. ^19
 20. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD. ^20
