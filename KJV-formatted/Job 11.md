 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, ^1
 2. Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? ^2
 3. Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? ^3
 4. For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. ^4
 5. But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; ^5
 6. And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. ^6
 7. Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? ^7
 8. It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? ^8
 9. The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. ^9
 10. If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? ^10
 11. For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? ^11
 12. For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt. ^12
 13. If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; ^13
 14. If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. ^14
 15. For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: ^15
 16. Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: ^16
 17. And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. ^17
 18. And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. ^18
 19. Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. ^19
 20. But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost. ^20
