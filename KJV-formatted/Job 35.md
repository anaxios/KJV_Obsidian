 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Elihu spake moreover, and said, ^1
 2. Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's? ^2
 3. For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? ^3
 4. I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. ^4
 5. Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. ^5
 6. If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? ^6
 7. If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? ^7
 8. Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. ^8
 9. By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. ^9
 10. But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; ^10
 11. Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? ^11
 12. There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. ^12
 13. Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. ^13
 14. Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him. ^14
 15. But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: ^15
 16. Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. ^16
