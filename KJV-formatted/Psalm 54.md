 3. For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. ^3
 4. Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. ^4
 5. He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. ^5
 6. I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good. ^6
 7. For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies. ^7
