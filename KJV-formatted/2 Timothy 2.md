 Book:: [[2 Timothy]]
 1. Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. ^1
 2. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. ^2
 3. Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. ^3
 4. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. ^4
 5. And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. ^5
 6. The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. ^6
 7. Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. ^7
 8. Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: ^8
 9. Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. ^9
 10. Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. ^10
 11. It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: ^11
 12. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: ^12
 13. If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. ^13
 14. Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. ^14
 15. Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. ^15
 16. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. ^16
 17. And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; ^17
 18. Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. ^18
 19. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. ^19
 20. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. ^20
 21. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work. ^21
 22. Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. ^22
 23. But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. ^23
 24. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, ^24
 25. In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; ^25
 26. And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. ^26
