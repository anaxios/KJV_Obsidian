 3. Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. ^3
 4. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. ^4
 5. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. ^5

 7. The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. ^7
 8. Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. ^8
 9. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. ^9
 10. Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. ^10
 11. The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. ^11
