 Book:: [[1 John]]
 1. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. ^1
 2. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: ^2
 3. And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. ^3
 4. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. ^4
 5. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. ^5
 6. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. ^6
 7. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. ^7
 8. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. ^8
 9. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. ^9
 10. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. ^10
 11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. ^11
 12. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. ^12
 13. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. ^13
 14. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. ^14
 15. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. ^15
 16. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. ^16
 17. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. ^17
 18. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. ^18
 19. We love him, because he first loved us. ^19
 20. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? ^20
 21. And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. ^21
