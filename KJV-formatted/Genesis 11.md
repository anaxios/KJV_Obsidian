 Book:: [[Genesis]]
 1. And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. ^1
 2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. ^2
 3. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. ^3
 4. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. ^4
 5. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. ^5
 6. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. ^6
 7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. ^7
 8. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. ^8
 9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. ^9
 10. These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: ^10
 11. And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. ^11
 12. And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: ^12
 13. And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. ^13
 14. And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: ^14
 15. And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. ^15
 16. And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: ^16
 17. And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. ^17
 18. And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: ^18
 19. And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. ^19
 20. And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: ^20
 21. And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. ^21
 22. And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: ^22
 23. And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. ^23
 24. And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: ^24
 25. And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. ^25
 26. And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. ^26
 27. Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. ^27
 28. And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. ^28
 29. And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. ^29
 30. But Sarai was barren; she had no child. ^30
 31. And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. ^31
 32. And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. ^32
