 Book:: [[Proverbs]]
 1. These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. ^1
 2. It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. ^2
 3. The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. ^3
 4. Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. ^4
 5. Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. ^5
 6. Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: ^6
 7. For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. ^7
 8. Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. ^8
 9. Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: ^9
 10. Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. ^10
 11. A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. ^11
 12. As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. ^12
 13. As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. ^13
 14. Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. ^14
 15. By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. ^15
 16. Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. ^16
 17. Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. ^17
 18. A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. ^18
 19. Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. ^19
 20. As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. ^20
 21. If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: ^21
 22. For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. ^22
 23. The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. ^23
 24. It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. ^24
 25. As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. ^25
 26. A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. ^26
 27. It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. ^27
 28. He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. ^28
