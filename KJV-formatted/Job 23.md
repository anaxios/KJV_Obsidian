 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Then Job answered and said, ^1
 2. Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. ^2
 3. Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! ^3
 4. I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. ^4
 5. I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. ^5
 6. Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. ^6
 7. There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. ^7
 8. Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: ^8
 9. On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: ^9
 10. But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. ^10
 11. My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. ^11
 12. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. ^12
 13. But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. ^13
 14. For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. ^14
 15. Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. ^15
 16. For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: ^16
 17. Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. ^17
