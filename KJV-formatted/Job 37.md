 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. ^1
 2. Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. ^2
 3. He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. ^3
 4. After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. ^4
 5. God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. ^5
 6. For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. ^6
 7. He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. ^7
 8. Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. ^8
 9. Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. ^9
 10. By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. ^10
 11. Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: ^11
 12. And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. ^12
 13. He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. ^13
 14. Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. ^14
 15. Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? ^15
 16. Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? ^16
 17. How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? ^17
 18. Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass? ^18
 19. Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. ^19
 20. Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. ^20
 21. And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. ^21
 22. Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty. ^22
 23. Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict. ^23
 24. Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. ^24
