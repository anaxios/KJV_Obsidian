 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? ^1
 2. Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. ^2
 3. Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. ^3
 4. Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. ^4
 5. A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. ^5
 6. But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. ^6
 7. They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. ^7
 8. They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. ^8
 9. We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. ^9
 10. O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? ^10
 11. Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom. ^11
 12. For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. ^12
 13. Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. ^13
 14. Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. ^14
 15. Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. ^15
 16. The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. ^16
 17. Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. ^17
 18. Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. ^18
 19. O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. ^19
 20. Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. ^20
 21. O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. ^21
 22. Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. ^22
 23. Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually. ^23
