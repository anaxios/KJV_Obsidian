 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. ^1
 2. Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. ^2
 3. For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. ^3
 4. I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. ^4
 5. I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. ^5
 6. I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: ^6
 7. That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. ^7
 8. LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. ^8
 9. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: ^9
 10. In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. ^10
 11. But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. ^11
 12. My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD. ^12
