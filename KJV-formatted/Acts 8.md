 Book:: [[Acts]]
 1. And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. ^1
 2. And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. ^2
 3. As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. ^3
 4. Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. ^4
 5. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. ^5
 6. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. ^6
 7. For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. ^7
 8. And there was great joy in that city. ^8
 9. But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: ^9
 10. To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. ^10
 11. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. ^11
 12. But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. ^12
 13. Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. ^13
 14. Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: ^14
 15. Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: ^15
 16. (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) ^16
 17. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. ^17
 18. And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, ^18
 19. Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. ^19
 20. But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. ^20
 21. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. ^21
 22. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. ^22
 23. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. ^23
 24. Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. ^24
 25. And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. ^25
 26. And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. ^26
 27. And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, ^27
 28. Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. ^28
 29. Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. ^29
 30. And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? ^30
 31. And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. ^31
 32. The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: ^32
 33. In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. ^33
 34. And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? ^34
 35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. ^35
 36. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? ^36
 37. And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. ^37
 38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. ^38
 39. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. ^39
 40. But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. ^40
