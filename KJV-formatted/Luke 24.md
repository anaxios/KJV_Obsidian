 Book:: [[Luke]]
 1. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. ^1
 2. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. ^2
 3. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. ^3
 4. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: ^4
 5. And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? ^5
 6. He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, ^6
 7. Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. ^7
 8. And they remembered his words, ^8
 9. And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. ^9
 10. It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. ^10
 11. And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. ^11
 12. Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. ^12
 13. And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. ^13
 14. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. ^14
 15. And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. ^15
 16. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. ^16
 17. And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? ^17
 18. And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? ^18
 19. And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: ^19
 20. And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. ^20
 21. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. ^21
 22. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; ^22
 23. And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. ^23
 24. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. ^24
 25. Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: ^25
 26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? ^26
 27. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. ^27
 28. And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. ^28
 29. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. ^29
 30. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. ^30
 31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. ^31
 32. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? ^32
 33. And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, ^33
 34. Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. ^34
 35. And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. ^35
 36. And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. ^36
 37. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. ^37
 38. And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? ^38
 39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. ^39
 40. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. ^40
 41. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? ^41
 42. And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. ^42
 43. And he took it, and did eat before them. ^43
 44. And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. ^44
 45. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, ^45
 46. And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: ^46
 47. And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. ^47
 48. And ye are witnesses of these things. ^48
 49. And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. ^49
 50. And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. ^50
 51. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. ^51
 52. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: ^52
 53. And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. ^53
