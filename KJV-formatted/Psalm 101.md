 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing. ^1
 2. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. ^2
 3. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. ^3
 4. A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. ^4
 5. Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. ^5
 6. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. ^6
 7. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. ^7
 8. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD. ^8
