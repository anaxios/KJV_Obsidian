 Book:: [[Proverbs]]
 1. As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. ^1
 2. As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. ^2
 3. A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. ^3
 4. Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. ^4
 5. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. ^5
 6. He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. ^6
 7. The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. ^7
 8. As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. ^8
 9. As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouths of fools. ^9
 10. The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. ^10
 11. As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. ^11
 12. Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. ^12
 13. The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. ^13
 14. As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. ^14
 15. The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. ^15
 16. The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. ^16
 17. He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. ^17
 18. As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, ^18
 19. So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? ^19
 20. Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. ^20
 21. As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. ^21
 22. The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. ^22
 23. Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. ^23
 24. He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; ^24
 25. When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. ^25
 26. Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. ^26
 27. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. ^27
 28. A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. ^28
