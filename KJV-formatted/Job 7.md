 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling? ^1
 2. As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work: ^2
 3. So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. ^3
 4. When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. ^4
 5. My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. ^5
 6. My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. ^6
 7. O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. ^7
 8. The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not. ^8
 9. As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. ^9
 10. He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. ^10
 11. Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. ^11
 12. Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? ^12
 13. When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints; ^13
 14. Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: ^14
 15. So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. ^15
 16. I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity. ^16
 17. What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? ^17
 18. And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? ^18
 19. How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? ^19
 20. I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? ^20
 21. And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be. ^21
