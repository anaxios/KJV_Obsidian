 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Then Job answered and said, ^1
 2. I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? ^2
 3. If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. ^3
 4. He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? ^4
 5. Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. ^5
 6. Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. ^6
 7. Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. ^7
 8. Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. ^8
 9. Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. ^9
 10. Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. ^10
 11. Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. ^11
 12. Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? ^12
 13. If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. ^13
 14. How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? ^14
 15. Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. ^15
 16. If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. ^16
 17. For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. ^17
 18. He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. ^18
 19. If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? ^19
 20. If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. ^20
 21. Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. ^21
 22. This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. ^22
 23. If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. ^23
 24. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? ^24
 25. Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. ^25
 26. They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. ^26
 27. If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: ^27
 28. I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. ^28
 29. If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? ^29
 30. If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; ^30
 31. Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. ^31
 32. For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. ^32
 33. Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. ^33
 34. Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: ^34
 35. Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me. ^35
