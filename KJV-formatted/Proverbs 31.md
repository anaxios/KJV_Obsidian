 Book:: [[Proverbs]]
 1. The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. ^1
 2. What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? ^2
 3. Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. ^3
 4. It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: ^4
 5. Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. ^5
 6. Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. ^6
 7. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. ^7
 8. Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. ^8
 9. Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. ^9
 10. Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. ^10
 11. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. ^11
 12. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. ^12
 13. She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. ^13
 14. She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. ^14
 15. She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. ^15
 16. She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. ^16
 17. She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. ^17
 18. She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. ^18
 19. She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. ^19
 20. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. ^20
 21. She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. ^21
 22. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. ^22
 23. Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. ^23
 24. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. ^24
 25. Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. ^25
 26. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. ^26
 27. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. ^27
 28. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. ^28
 29. Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. ^29
 30. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. ^30
 31. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. ^31
