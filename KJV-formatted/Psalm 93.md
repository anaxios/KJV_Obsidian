 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. ^1
 2. Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. ^2
 3. The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. ^3
 4. The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. ^4
 5. Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever. ^5
