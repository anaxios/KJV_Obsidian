 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions: ^1
 2. How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob; ^2
 3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; ^3
 4. I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, ^4
 5. Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. ^5
 6. Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. ^6
 7. We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. ^7
 8. Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. ^8
 9. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. ^9
 10. For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. ^10
 11. The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. ^11
 12. If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. ^12
 13. For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. ^13
 14. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. ^14
 15. I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. ^15
 16. I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. ^16
 17. There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. ^17
 18. His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish. ^18
