 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: ^1
 2. Both low and high, rich and poor, together. ^2
 3. My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. ^3
 4. I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. ^4
 5. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? ^5
 6. They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; ^6
 7. None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: ^7
 8. (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) ^8
 9. That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. ^9
 10. For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. ^10
 11. Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. ^11
 12. Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. ^12
 13. This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. ^13
 14. Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. ^14
 15. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. ^15
 16. Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; ^16
 17. For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. ^17
 18. Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. ^18
 19. He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. ^19
 20. Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. ^20
