 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, ^1
 2. Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? ^2
 3. Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? ^3
 4. Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? ^4
 5. Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? ^5
 6. For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. ^6
 7. Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. ^7
 8. But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. ^8
 9. Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. ^9
 10. Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; ^10
 11. Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. ^11
 12. Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! ^12
 13. And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? ^13
 14. Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. ^14
 15. Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? ^15
 16. Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: ^16
 17. Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? ^17
 18. Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^18
 19. The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. ^19
 20. Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. ^20
 21. Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. ^21
 22. Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. ^22
 23. If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. ^23
 24. Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. ^24
 25. Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. ^25
 26. For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. ^26
 27. Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. ^27
 28. Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. ^28
 29. When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. ^29
 30. He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. ^30
