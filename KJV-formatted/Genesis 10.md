 Book:: [[Genesis]]
 1. Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. ^1
 2. The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. ^2
 3. And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. ^3
 4. And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. ^4
 5. By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. ^5
 6. And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. ^6
 7. And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. ^7
 8. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. ^8
 9. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. ^9
 10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. ^10
 11. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, ^11
 12. And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. ^12
 13. And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, ^13
 14. And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. ^14
 15. And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, ^15
 16. And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, ^16
 17. And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, ^17
 18. And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. ^18
 19. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. ^19
 20. These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. ^20
 21. Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. ^21
 22. The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. ^22
 23. And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. ^23
 24. And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. ^24
 25. And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. ^25
 26. And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, ^26
 27. And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, ^27
 28. And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, ^28
 29. And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. ^29
 30. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. ^30
 31. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. ^31
 32. These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. ^32
