 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. ^1
 2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. ^2
 3. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. ^3
 4. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. ^4
 5. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. ^5
 6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah. ^6
 7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God. ^7
 8. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me. ^8
 9. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds. ^9
 10. For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. ^10
 11. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. ^11
 12. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. ^12
 13. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? ^13
 14. Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: ^14
 15. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. ^15
 16. But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? ^16
 17. Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee. ^17
 18. When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. ^18
 19. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. ^19
 20. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son. ^20
 21. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. ^21
 22. Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. ^22
 23. Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. ^23
