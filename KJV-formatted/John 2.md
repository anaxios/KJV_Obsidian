 Book:: [[John]]
 1. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: ^1
 2. And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. ^2
 3. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. ^3
 4. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. ^4
 5. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. ^5
 6. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. ^6
 7. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. ^7
 8. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. ^8
 9. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, ^9
 10. And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. ^10
 11. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. ^11
 12. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. ^12
 13. And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ^13
 14. And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: ^14
 15. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; ^15
 16. And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. ^16
 17. And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. ^17
 18. Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? ^18
 19. Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. ^19
 20. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? ^20
 21. But he spake of the temple of his body. ^21
 22. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. ^22
 23. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. ^23
 24. But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, ^24
 25. And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. ^25
