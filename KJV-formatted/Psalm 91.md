 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. ^1
 2. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. ^2
 3. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. ^3
 4. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. ^4
 5. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; ^5
 6. Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. ^6
 7. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. ^7
 8. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. ^8
 9. Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; ^9
 10. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. ^10
 11. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. ^11
 12. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. ^12
 13. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. ^13
 14. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. ^14
 15. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. ^15
 16. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. ^16
