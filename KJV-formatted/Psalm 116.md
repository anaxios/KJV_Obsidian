 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. ^1
 2. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. ^2
 3. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. ^3
 4. Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. ^4
 5. Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. ^5
 6. The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. ^6
 7. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. ^7
 8. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. ^8
 9. I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. ^9
 10. I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: ^10
 11. I said in my haste, All men are liars. ^11
 12. What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me? ^12
 13. I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. ^13
 14. I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. ^14
 15. Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. ^15
 16. O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. ^16
 17. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. ^17
 18. I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. ^18
 19. In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. ^19
