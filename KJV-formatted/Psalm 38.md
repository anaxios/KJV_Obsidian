 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. ^1
 2. For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. ^2
 3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. ^3
 4. For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. ^4
 5. My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. ^5
 6. I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. ^6
 7. For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. ^7
 8. I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. ^8
 9. Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. ^9
 10. My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. ^10
 11. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. ^11
 12. They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. ^12
 13. But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. ^13
 14. Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. ^14
 15. For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. ^15
 16. For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. ^16
 17. For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. ^17
 18. For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. ^18
 19. But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. ^19
 20. They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is. ^20
 21. Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. ^21
 22. Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. ^22
