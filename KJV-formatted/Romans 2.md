 Book:: [[Romans]]
 1. Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. ^1
 2. But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. ^2
 3. And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? ^3
 4. Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? ^4
 5. But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; ^5
 6. Who will render to every man according to his deeds: ^6
 7. To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: ^7
 8. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, ^8
 9. Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; ^9
 10. But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: ^10
 11. For there is no respect of persons with God. ^11
 12. For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; ^12
 13. (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. ^13
 14. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: ^14
 15. Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) ^15
 16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. ^16
 17. Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, ^17
 18. And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; ^18
 19. And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, ^19
 20. An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. ^20
 21. Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? ^21
 22. Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? ^22
 23. Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? ^23
 24. For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. ^24
 25. For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. ^25
 26. Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? ^26
 27. And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? ^27
 28. For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: ^28
 29. But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. ^29
