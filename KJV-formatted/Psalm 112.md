 2. His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. ^2
 3. Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. ^3
 4. Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. ^4
 5. A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. ^5
 6. Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. ^6
 7. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. ^7
 8. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies. ^8
 9. He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. ^9
 10. The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. ^10
