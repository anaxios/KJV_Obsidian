 Book:: [[Proverbs]]
 1. My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: ^1
 2. For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. ^2
 3. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: ^3
 4. So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. ^4
 5. Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. ^5
 6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. ^6
 7. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. ^7
 8. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. ^8
 9. Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: ^9
 10. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. ^10
 11. My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: ^11
 12. For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. ^12
 13. Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. ^13
 14. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. ^14
 15. She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. ^15
 16. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. ^16
 17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. ^17
 18. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. ^18
 19. The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. ^19
 20. By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. ^20
 21. My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: ^21
 22. So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. ^22
 23. Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. ^23
 24. When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. ^24
 25. Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. ^25
 26. For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. ^26
 27. Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. ^27
 28. Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. ^28
 29. Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. ^29
 30. Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. ^30
 31. Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. ^31
 32. For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. ^32
 33. The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. ^33
 34. Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. ^34
 35. The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. ^35
