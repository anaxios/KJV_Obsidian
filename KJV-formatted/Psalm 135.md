 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD. ^1
 2. Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. ^2
 3. Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. ^3
 4. For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. ^4
 5. For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. ^5
 6. Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. ^6
 7. He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. ^7
 8. Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. ^8
 9. Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. ^9
 10. Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; ^10
 11. Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: ^11
 12. And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. ^12
 13. Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. ^13
 14. For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants. ^14
 15. The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. ^15
 16. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; ^16
 17. They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. ^17
 18. They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them. ^18
 19. Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron: ^19
 20. Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD. ^20
 21. Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. ^21
