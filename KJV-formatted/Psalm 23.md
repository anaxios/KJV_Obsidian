 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. ^1
 2. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. ^2
 3. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. ^3
 4. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. ^4
 5. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. ^5
 6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. ^6
