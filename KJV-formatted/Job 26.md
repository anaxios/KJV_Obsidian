 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. But Job answered and said, ^1
 2. How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? ^2
 3. How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? ^3
 4. To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? ^4
 5. Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. ^5
 6. Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. ^6
 7. He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. ^7
 8. He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. ^8
 9. He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. ^9
 10. He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. ^10
 11. The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. ^11
 12. He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. ^12
 13. By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. ^13
 14. Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? ^14
