 Book:: [[John]]
 1. When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, ^1
 2. (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) ^2
 3. He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. ^3
 4. And he must needs go through Samaria. ^4
 5. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. ^5
 6. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. ^6
 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. ^7
 8. (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) ^8
 9. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. ^9
 10. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. ^10
 11. The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? ^11
 12. Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? ^12
 13. Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: ^13
 14. But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. ^14
 15. The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. ^15
 16. Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. ^16
 17. The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: ^17
 18. For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. ^18
 19. The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. ^19
 20. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. ^20
 21. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. ^21
 22. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. ^22
 23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. ^23
 24. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. ^24
 25. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. ^25
 26. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. ^26
 27. And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? ^27
 28. The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, ^28
 29. Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? ^29
 30. Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. ^30
 31. In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. ^31
 32. But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. ^32
 33. Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? ^33
 34. Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. ^34
 35. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. ^35
 36. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. ^36
 37. And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. ^37
 38. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. ^38
 39. And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. ^39
 40. So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. ^40
 41. And many more believed because of his own word; ^41
 42. And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. ^42
 43. Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. ^43
 44. For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. ^44
 45. Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. ^45
 46. So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. ^46
 47. When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. ^47
 48. Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. ^48
 49. The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. ^49
 50. Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. ^50
 51. And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. ^51
 52. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. ^52
 53. So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. ^53
 54. This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. ^54
