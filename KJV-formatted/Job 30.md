 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. ^1
 2. Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished? ^2
 3. For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. ^3
 4. Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat. ^4
 5. They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;) ^5
 6. To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks. ^6
 7. Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. ^7
 8. They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. ^8
 9. And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. ^9
 10. They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. ^10
 11. Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. ^11
 12. Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. ^12
 13. They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. ^13
 14. They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me. ^14
 15. Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. ^15
 16. And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. ^16
 17. My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. ^17
 18. By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. ^18
 19. He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. ^19
 20. I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. ^20
 21. Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. ^21
 22. Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance. ^22
 23. For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. ^23
 24. Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. ^24
 25. Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor? ^25
 26. When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. ^26
 27. My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me. ^27
 28. I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation. ^28
 29. I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. ^29
 30. My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. ^30
 31. My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep. ^31
