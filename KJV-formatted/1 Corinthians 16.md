 Book:: [[1 Corinthians]]
 1. Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. ^1
 2. Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. ^2
 3. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. ^3
 4. And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. ^4
 5. Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. ^5
 6. And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. ^6
 7. For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. ^7
 8. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. ^8
 9. For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. ^9
 10. Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. ^10
 11. Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. ^11
 12. As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time. ^12
 13. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. ^13
 14. Let all your things be done with charity. ^14
 15. I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) ^15
 16. That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth. ^16
 17. I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. ^17
 18. For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. ^18
 19. The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. ^19
 20. All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. ^20
 21. The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. ^21
 22. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. ^22
 23. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. ^23
 24. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. ^24
