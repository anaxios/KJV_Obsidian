 Book:: [[Ephesians]]
 1. Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; ^1
 2. And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. ^2
 3. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; ^3
 4. Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. ^4
 5. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. ^5
 6. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. ^6
 7. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. ^7
 8. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: ^8
 9. (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) ^9
 10. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. ^10
 11. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. ^11
 12. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. ^12
 13. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. ^13
 14. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. ^14
 15. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, ^15
 16. Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. ^16
 17. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. ^17
 18. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; ^18
 19. Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; ^19
 20. Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; ^20
 21. Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. ^21
 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. ^22
 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. ^23
 24. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. ^24
 25. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; ^25
 26. That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, ^26
 27. That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. ^27
 28. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. ^28
 29. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: ^29
 30. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. ^30
 31. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. ^31
 32. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. ^32
 33. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. ^33
