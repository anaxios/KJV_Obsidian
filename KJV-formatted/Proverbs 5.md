 Book:: [[Proverbs]]
 1. My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: ^1
 2. That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. ^2
 3. For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: ^3
 4. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. ^4
 5. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. ^5
 6. Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. ^6
 7. Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. ^7
 8. Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: ^8
 9. Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: ^9
 10. Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; ^10
 11. And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, ^11
 12. And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; ^12
 13. And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! ^13
 14. I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. ^14
 15. Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. ^15
 16. Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. ^16
 17. Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. ^17
 18. Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. ^18
 19. Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. ^19
 20. And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? ^20
 21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. ^21
 22. His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. ^22
 23. He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. ^23
