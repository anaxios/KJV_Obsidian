 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. ^1
 2. Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. ^2
 3. I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. ^3
 4. For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. ^4
 5. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; ^5
 6. That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. ^6
 7. God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. ^7
 8. Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; ^8
 9. Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. ^9
 10. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? ^10
 11. Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? ^11
 12. Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. ^12
 13. Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. ^13
