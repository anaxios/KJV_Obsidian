 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. ^1
 2. Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. ^2
 3. He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. ^3
 4. The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. ^4
 5. As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. ^5
 6. The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. ^6
 7. There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: ^7
 8. The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. ^8
 9. He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. ^9
 10. He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. ^10
 11. He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. ^11
 12. But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? ^12
 13. Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. ^13
 14. The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. ^14
 15. It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. ^15
 16. It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. ^16
 17. The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. ^17
 18. No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. ^18
 19. The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. ^19
 20. Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? ^20
 21. Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. ^21
 22. Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. ^22
 23. God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. ^23
 24. For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; ^24
 25. To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. ^25
 26. When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: ^26
 27. Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. ^27
 28. And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. ^28
