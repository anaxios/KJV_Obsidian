 4. The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. ^4
 5. Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, ^5
 6. Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! ^6
 7. He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; ^7
 8. That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. ^8
 9. He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. ^9
