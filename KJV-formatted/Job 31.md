 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? ^1
 2. For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? ^2
 3. Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? ^3
 4. Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? ^4
 5. If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; ^5
 6. Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity. ^6
 7. If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; ^7
 8. Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. ^8
 9. If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; ^9
 10. Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. ^10
 11. For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. ^11
 12. For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. ^12
 13. If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; ^13
 14. What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? ^14
 15. Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? ^15
 16. If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; ^16
 17. Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; ^17
 18. (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) ^18
 19. If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; ^19
 20. If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; ^20
 21. If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: ^21
 22. Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. ^22
 23. For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. ^23
 24. If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; ^24
 25. If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; ^25
 26. If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; ^26
 27. And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: ^27
 28. This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. ^28
 29. If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: ^29
 30. Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. ^30
 31. If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. ^31
 32. The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller. ^32
 33. If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: ^33
 34. Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? ^34
 35. Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. ^35
 36. Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. ^36
 37. I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. ^37
 38. If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; ^38
 39. If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: ^39
 40. Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. ^40
