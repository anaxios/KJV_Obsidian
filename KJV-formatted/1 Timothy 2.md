 Book:: [[1 Timothy]]
 1. I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; ^1
 2. For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. ^2
 3. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; ^3
 4. Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. ^4
 5. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; ^5
 6. Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. ^6
 7. Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. ^7
 8. I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. ^8
 9. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; ^9
 10. But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. ^10
 11. Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. ^11
 12. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. ^12
 13. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. ^13
 14. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. ^14
 15. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. ^15
