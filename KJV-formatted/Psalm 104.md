 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. ^1
 2. Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: ^2
 3. Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: ^3
 4. Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: ^4
 5. Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. ^5
 6. Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. ^6
 7. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. ^7
 8. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. ^8
 9. Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. ^9
 10. He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills. ^10
 11. They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. ^11
 12. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches. ^12
 13. He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. ^13
 14. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; ^14
 15. And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart. ^15
 16. The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; ^16
 17. Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. ^17
 18. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies. ^18
 19. He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. ^19
 20. Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. ^20
 21. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. ^21
 22. The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. ^22
 23. Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. ^23
 24. O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. ^24
 25. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. ^25
 26. There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. ^26
 27. These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. ^27
 28. That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. ^28
 29. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. ^29
 30. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. ^30
 31. The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. ^31
 32. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. ^32
 33. I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. ^33
 34. My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. ^34
 35. Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. ^35
