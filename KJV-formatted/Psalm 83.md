 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. ^1
 2. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. ^2
 3. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. ^3
 4. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. ^4
 5. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: ^5
 6. The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; ^6
 7. Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; ^7
 8. Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. ^8
 9. Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: ^9
 10. Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. ^10
 11. Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: ^11
 12. Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. ^12
 13. O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. ^13
 14. As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; ^14
 15. So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. ^15
 16. Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. ^16
 17. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: ^17
 18. That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. ^18
