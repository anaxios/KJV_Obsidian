 Book:: [[1 Thessalonians]]
 1. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^1
 2. We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; ^2
 3. Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; ^3
 4. Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. ^4
 5. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. ^5
 6. And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost. ^6
 7. So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. ^7
 8. For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. ^8
 9. For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; ^9
 10. And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come. ^10
