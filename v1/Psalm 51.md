 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. ^1
 2. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. ^2
 3. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. ^3
 4. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. ^4
 5. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. ^5
 6. Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. ^6
 7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. ^7
 8. Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. ^8
 9. Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. ^9
 10. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. ^10
 11. Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. ^11
 12. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. ^12
 13. Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. ^13
 14. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. ^14
 15. O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. ^15
 16. For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering. ^16
 17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. ^17
 18. Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. ^18
 19. Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar. ^19
