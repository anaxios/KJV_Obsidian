 Book:: [[John]]
 1. Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. ^1
 2. There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. ^2
 3. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. ^3
 4. Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, ^4
 5. Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? ^5
 6. This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. ^6
 7. Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. ^7
 8. For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. ^8
 9. Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. ^9
 10. But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; ^10
 11. Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. ^11
 12. On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, ^12
 13. Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. ^13
 14. And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, ^14
 15. Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. ^15
 16. These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. ^16
 17. The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. ^17
 18. For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. ^18
 19. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. ^19
 20. And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: ^20
 21. The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. ^21
 22. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. ^22
 23. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. ^23
 24. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. ^24
 25. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. ^25
 26. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. ^26
 27. Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. ^27
 28. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. ^28
 29. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. ^29
 30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. ^30
 31. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. ^31
 32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. ^32
 33. This he said, signifying what death he should die. ^33
 34. The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? ^34
 35. Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. ^35
 36. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. ^36
 37. But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: ^37
 38. That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? ^38
 39. Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, ^39
 40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. ^40
 41. These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. ^41
 42. Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: ^42
 43. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. ^43
 44. Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. ^44
 45. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. ^45
 46. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. ^46
 47. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. ^47
 48. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. ^48
 49. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. ^49
 50. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. ^50
