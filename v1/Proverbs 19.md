 Book:: [[Proverbs]]

 4. Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. ^4
 5. A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. ^5
 6. Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. ^6
 7. All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him. ^7
 8. He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. ^8
 9. A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish. ^9
 10. Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. ^10
 11. The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. ^11
 12. The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass. ^12
 13. A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. ^13
 14. House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD. ^14
 15. Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. ^15
 16. He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die. ^16
 17. He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. ^17
 18. Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. ^18
 19. A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again. ^19
 20. Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. ^20
 21. There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. ^21
 22. The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar. ^22
 23. The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. ^23
 24. A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. ^24
 25. Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. ^25
 26. He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. ^26
 27. Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. ^27
 28. An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. ^28
 29. Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools. ^29
