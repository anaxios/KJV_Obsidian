 Book:: [[Genesis]]
 1. Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. ^1
 2. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. ^2
 3. And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. ^3
 4. And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. ^4
 5. And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. ^5
 6. But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. ^6
 7. And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. ^7
 8. Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. ^8
 9. And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; ^9
 10. The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. ^10
 11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. ^11
 12. Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: ^12
 13. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, ^13
 14. And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, ^14
 15. Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: ^15
 16. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. ^16
 17. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. ^17
 18. And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren. ^18
 19. And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: ^19
 20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. ^20
 21. And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. ^21
 22. And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD. ^22
 23. And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. ^23
 24. And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. ^24
 25. And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. ^25
 26. And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. ^26
 27. And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. ^27
 28. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. ^28
 29. And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: ^29
 30. And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. ^30
 31. And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. ^31
 32. And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? ^32
 33. And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. ^33
 34. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. ^34
