 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. ^1
 2. Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah. ^2
 3. Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. ^3
 4. Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease. ^4
 5. Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? ^5
 6. Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? ^6
 7. Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. ^7
 8. I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. ^8
 9. Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. ^9
 10. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. ^10
 11. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. ^11
 12. Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. ^12
 13. Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps. ^13
