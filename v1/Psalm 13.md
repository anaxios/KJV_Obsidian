 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? ^1
 2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? ^2
 3. Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; ^3
 4. Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. ^4
 5. But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. ^5
 6. I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. ^6
