 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; ^1
 2. For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. ^2
 3. They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. ^3
 4. For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. ^4
 5. And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. ^5
 6. Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. ^6
 7. When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. ^7
 8. Let his days be few; and let another take his office. ^8
 9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. ^9
 10. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. ^10
 11. Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. ^11
 12. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. ^12
 13. Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. ^13
 14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. ^14
 15. Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. ^15
 16. Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. ^16
 17. As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. ^17
 18. As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. ^18
 19. Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. ^19
 20. Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. ^20
 21. But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. ^21
 22. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. ^22
 23. I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. ^23
 24. My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. ^24
 25. I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads. ^25
 26. Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: ^26
 27. That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it. ^27
 28. Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. ^28
 29. Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. ^29
 30. I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. ^30
 31. For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul. ^31
