 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. ^1
 2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. ^2
 3. Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^3
 4. O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? ^4
 5. Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. ^5
 6. Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. ^6
 7. Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^7
 8. Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. ^8
 9. Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. ^9
 10. The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. ^10
 11. She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. ^11
 12. Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? ^12
 13. The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. ^13
 14. Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; ^14
 15. And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. ^15
 16. It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. ^16
 17. Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. ^17
 18. So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. ^18
 19. Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^19
