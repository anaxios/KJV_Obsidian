 Book:: [[Hosea]]
 1. When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. ^1
 2. As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. ^2
 3. I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. ^3
 4. I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them. ^4
 5. He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. ^5
 6. And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels. ^6
 7. And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him. ^7
 8. How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. ^8
 9. I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. ^9
 10. They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west. ^10
 11. They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD. ^11
 12. Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints. ^12
