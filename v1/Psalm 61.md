 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. ^1
 2. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. ^2
 3. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. ^3
 4. I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. ^4
 5. For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. ^5
 6. Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations. ^6
 7. He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him. ^7
 8. So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows. ^8
