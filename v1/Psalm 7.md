 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: ^1
 2. Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. ^2
 3. O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; ^3
 4. If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) ^4
 5. Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. ^5
 6. Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. ^6
 7. So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. ^7
 8. The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. ^8
 9. Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. ^9
 10. My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. ^10
 11. God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. ^11
 12. If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. ^12
 13. He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. ^13
 14. Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. ^14
 15. He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. ^15
 16. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. ^16
 17. I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high. ^17
