 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. ^1
 2. How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out. ^2
 3. For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. ^3
 4. Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob. ^4
 5. Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. ^5
 6. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. ^6
 7. But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. ^7
 8. In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. ^8
 9. But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies. ^9
 10. Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. ^10
 11. Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen. ^11
 12. Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price. ^12
 13. Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. ^13
 14. Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. ^14
 15. My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, ^15
 16. For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. ^16
 17. All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. ^17
 18. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; ^18
 19. Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. ^19
 20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; ^20
 21. Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. ^21
 22. Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. ^22
 23. Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. ^23
 24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? ^24
 25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. ^25
 26. Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake. ^26
