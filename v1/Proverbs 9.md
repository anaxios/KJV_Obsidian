 Book:: [[Proverbs]]
 1. Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: ^1
 2. She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. ^2
 3. She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, ^3
 4. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ^4
 5. Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. ^5
 6. Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. ^6
 7. He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot. ^7
 8. Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. ^8
 9. Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. ^9
 10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. ^10
 11. For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. ^11
 12. If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. ^12
 13. A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. ^13
 14. For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, ^14
 15. To call passengers who go right on their ways: ^15
 16. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ^16
 17. Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. ^17
 18. But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell. ^18
