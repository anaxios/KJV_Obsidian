 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. ^1
 2. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. ^2
 3. How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence. ^3
 4. They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. ^4
 5. My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. ^5
 6. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved. ^6
 7. In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. ^7
 8. Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah. ^8
 9. Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. ^9
 10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them. ^10
 11. God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. ^11
 12. Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work. ^12
