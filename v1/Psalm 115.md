 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. ^1
 2. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? ^2
 3. But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. ^3
 4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. ^4
 5. They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: ^5
 6. They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: ^6
 7. They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. ^7
 8. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. ^8
 9. O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. ^9
 10. O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. ^10
 11. Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. ^11
 12. The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. ^12
 13. He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. ^13
 14. The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children. ^14
 15. Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. ^15
 16. The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. ^16
 17. The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. ^17
 18. But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD. ^18
