 Book:: [[Proverbs]]
 1. Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife. ^1
 2. A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. ^2
 3. The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. ^3
 4. A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. ^4
 5. Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. ^5
 6. Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers. ^6
 7. Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. ^7
 8. A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. ^8
 9. He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. ^9
 10. A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. ^10
 11. An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. ^11
 12. Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. ^12
 13. Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. ^13
 14. The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. ^14
 15. He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD. ^15
 16. Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it? ^16
 17. A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. ^17
 18. A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend. ^18
 19. He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. ^19
 20. He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. ^20
 21. He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. ^21
 22. A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. ^22
 23. A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. ^23
 24. Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. ^24
 25. A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. ^25
 26. Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity. ^26
 27. He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. ^27
 28. Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding. ^28
