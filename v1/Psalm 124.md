 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say; ^1
 2. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: ^2
 3. Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: ^3
 4. Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: ^4
 5. Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. ^5
 6. Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. ^6
 7. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. ^7
 8. Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth. ^8
