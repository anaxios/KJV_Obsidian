 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. ^1
 2. Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. ^2
 3. If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? ^3
 4. But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. ^4
 5. I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. ^5
 6. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. ^6
 7. Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. ^7
 8. And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. ^8
