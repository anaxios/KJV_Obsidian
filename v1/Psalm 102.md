 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. ^1
 2. Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. ^2
 3. For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. ^3
 4. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. ^4
 5. By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. ^5
 6. I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. ^6
 7. I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. ^7
 8. Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. ^8
 9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping. ^9
 10. Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. ^10
 11. My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. ^11
 12. But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. ^12
 13. Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. ^13
 14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. ^14
 15. So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. ^15
 16. When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. ^16
 17. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. ^17
 18. This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. ^18
 19. For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; ^19
 20. To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; ^20
 21. To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; ^21
 22. When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. ^22
 23. He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. ^23
 24. I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. ^24
 25. Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. ^25
 26. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: ^26
 27. But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. ^27
 28. The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee. ^28
