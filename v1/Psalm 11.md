 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? ^1
 2. For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. ^2
 3. If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? ^3
 4. The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. ^4
 5. The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. ^5
 6. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. ^6
 7. For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright. ^7
