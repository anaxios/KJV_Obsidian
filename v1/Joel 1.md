 Book:: [[Joel]]
 1. The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. ^1
 2. Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? ^2
 3. Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation. ^3
 4. That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. ^4
 5. Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. ^5
 6. For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. ^6
 7. He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. ^7
 8. Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. ^8
 9. The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn. ^9
 10. The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. ^10
 11. Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. ^11
 12. The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men. ^12
 13. Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. ^13
 14. Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD, ^14
 15. Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. ^15
 16. Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God? ^16
 17. The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. ^17
 18. How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. ^18
 19. O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. ^19
 20. The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. ^20
