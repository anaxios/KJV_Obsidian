 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Then Job answered and said, ^1
 2. How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? ^2
 3. These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. ^3
 4. And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. ^4
 5. If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: ^5
 6. Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. ^6
 7. Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. ^7
 8. He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. ^8
 9. He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. ^9
 10. He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree. ^10
 11. He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. ^11
 12. His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. ^12
 13. He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. ^13
 14. My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. ^14
 15. They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. ^15
 16. I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. ^16
 17. My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body. ^17
 18. Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. ^18
 19. All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. ^19
 20. My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. ^20
 21. Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. ^21
 22. Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? ^22
 23. Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! ^23
 24. That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! ^24
 25. For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: ^25
 26. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: ^26
 27. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. ^27
 28. But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? ^28
 29. Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment. ^29
