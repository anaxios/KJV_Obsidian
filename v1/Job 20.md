 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, ^1
 2. Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. ^2
 3. I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. ^3
 4. Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, ^4
 5. That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? ^5
 6. Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; ^6
 7. Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? ^7
 8. He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. ^8
 9. The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. ^9
 10. His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. ^10
 11. His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. ^11
 12. Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; ^12
 13. Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: ^13
 14. Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. ^14
 15. He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. ^15
 16. He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. ^16
 17. He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. ^17
 18. That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein. ^18
 19. Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; ^19
 20. Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. ^20
 21. There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. ^21
 22. In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. ^22
 23. When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. ^23
 24. He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through. ^24
 25. It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him. ^25
 26. All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. ^26
 27. The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. ^27
 28. The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. ^28
 29. This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. ^29
