 Book:: [[Genesis]]
 1. Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee: ^1
 2. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: ^2
 3. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. ^3
 4. So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. ^4
 5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. ^5
 6. And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. ^6
 7. And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. ^7
 8. And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. ^8
 9. And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. ^9
 10. And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. ^10
 11. And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: ^11
 12. Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. ^12
 13. Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. ^13
 14. And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. ^14
 15. The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. ^15
 16. And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. ^16
 17. And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. ^17
 18. And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? ^18
 19. Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. ^19
 20. And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. ^20
