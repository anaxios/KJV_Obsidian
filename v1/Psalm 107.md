 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. ^1
 2. Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; ^2
 3. And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. ^3
 4. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. ^4
 5. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. ^5
 6. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. ^6
 7. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. ^7
 8. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ^8
 9. For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. ^9
 10. Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; ^10
 11. Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: ^11
 12. Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. ^12
 13. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. ^13
 14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. ^14
 15. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ^15
 16. For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. ^16
 17. Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. ^17
 18. Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. ^18
 19. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. ^19
 20. He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. ^20
 21. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ^21
 22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. ^22
 23. They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; ^23
 24. These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. ^24
 25. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. ^25
 26. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. ^26
 27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. ^27
 28. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. ^28
 29. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. ^29
 30. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. ^30
 31. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ^31
 32. Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. ^32
 33. He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; ^33
 34. A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. ^34
 35. He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. ^35
 36. And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; ^36
 37. And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. ^37
 38. He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. ^38
 39. Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. ^39
 40. He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. ^40
 41. Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. ^41
 42. The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. ^42
 43. Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. ^43
