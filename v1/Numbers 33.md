 53. And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it. ^53
 54. And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. ^54
 55. But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. ^55
 56. Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them. ^56
