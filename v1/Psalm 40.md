 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. ^1
 2. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. ^2
 3. And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. ^3
 4. Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. ^4
 5. Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered. ^5
 6. Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. ^6
 7. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, ^7
 8. I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart. ^8
 9. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. ^9
 10. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. ^10
 11. Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. ^11
 12. For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me. ^12
 13. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me. ^13
 14. Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. ^14
 15. Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha. ^15
 16. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified. ^16
 17. But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God. ^17
