 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. But Job answered and said, ^1
 2. Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. ^2
 3. Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. ^3
 4. As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? ^4
 5. Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. ^5
 6. Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. ^6
 7. Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? ^7
 8. Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. ^8
 9. Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. ^9
 10. Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. ^10
 11. They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. ^11
 12. They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. ^12
 13. They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. ^13
 14. Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. ^14
 15. What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? ^15
 16. Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^16
 17. How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. ^17
 18. They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. ^18
 19. God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. ^19
 20. His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. ^20
 21. For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? ^21
 22. Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. ^22
 23. One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. ^23
 24. His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. ^24
 25. And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. ^25
 26. They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. ^26
 27. Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. ^27
 28. For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? ^28
 29. Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, ^29
 30. That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. ^30
 31. Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? ^31
 32. Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. ^32
 33. The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. ^33
 34. How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? ^34
