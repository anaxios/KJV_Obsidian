 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. ^1
 2. But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. ^2
 3. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. ^3
 4. For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. ^4
 5. They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. ^5
 6. Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment. ^6
 7. Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. ^7
 8. They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. ^8
 9. They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. ^9
 10. Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. ^10
 11. And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? ^11
 12. Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches. ^12
 13. Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. ^13
 14. For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. ^14
 15. If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. ^15
 16. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; ^16
 17. Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. ^17
 18. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. ^18
 19. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. ^19
 20. As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. ^20
 21. Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. ^21
 22. So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. ^22
 23. Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. ^23
 24. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. ^24
 25. Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. ^25
 26. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. ^26
 27. For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. ^27
 28. But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works. ^28
