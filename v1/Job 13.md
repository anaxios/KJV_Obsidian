 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it. ^1
 2. What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. ^2
 3. Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. ^3
 4. But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value. ^4
 5. O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. ^5
 6. Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. ^6
 7. Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? ^7
 8. Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? ^8
 9. Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him? ^9
 10. He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. ^10
 11. Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? ^11
 12. Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. ^12
 13. Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will. ^13
 14. Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? ^14
 15. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. ^15
 16. He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him. ^16
 17. Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. ^17
 18. Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified. ^18
 19. Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. ^19
 20. Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee. ^20
 21. Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. ^21
 22. Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. ^22
 23. How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin. ^23
 24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? ^24
 25. Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? ^25
 26. For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. ^26
 27. Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. ^27
 28. And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten. ^28
