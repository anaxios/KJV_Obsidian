 41. All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs. ^41
 42. These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities. ^42
 43. And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. ^43
