 Book:: [[John]]
 1. And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. ^1
 2. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? ^2
 3. Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. ^3
 4. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. ^4
 5. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. ^5
 6. When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, ^6
 7. And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. ^7
 8. The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? ^8
 9. Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. ^9
 10. Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? ^10
 11. He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. ^11
 12. Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. ^12
 13. They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. ^13
 14. And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. ^14
 15. Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. ^15
 16. Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. ^16
 17. They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. ^17
 18. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. ^18
 19. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? ^19
 20. His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: ^20
 21. But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. ^21
 22. These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. ^22
 23. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. ^23
 24. Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. ^24
 25. He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. ^25
 26. Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? ^26
 27. He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? ^27
 28. Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. ^28
 29. We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. ^29
 30. The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. ^30
 31. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. ^31
 32. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. ^32
 33. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. ^33
 34. They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. ^34
 35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? ^35
 36. He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? ^36
 37. And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. ^37
 38. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. ^38
 39. And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. ^39
 40. And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? ^40
 41. Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. ^41
