 Book:: [[Matthew]]
 1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, ^1
 2. Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. ^2
 3. Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, ^3
 4. And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. ^4
 5. But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. ^5
 6. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, ^6
 7. There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. ^7
 8. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? ^8
 9. For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. ^9
 10. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. ^10
 11. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. ^11
 12. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. ^12
 13. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. ^13
 14. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, ^14
 15. And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. ^15
 16. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. ^16
 17. Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? ^17
 18. And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. ^18
 19. And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. ^19
 20. Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. ^20
 21. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. ^21
 22. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? ^22
 23. And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. ^23
 24. The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. ^24
 25. Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. ^25
 26. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. ^26
 27. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; ^27
 28. For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. ^28
 29. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. ^29
 30. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. ^30
 31. Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. ^31
 32. But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. ^32
 33. Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. ^33
 34. Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. ^34
 35. Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. ^35
 36. Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. ^36
 37. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. ^37
 38. Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. ^38
 39. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. ^39
 40. And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? ^40
 41. Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. ^41
 42. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. ^42
 43. And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. ^43
 44. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. ^44
 45. Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ^45
 46. Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. ^46
 47. And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. ^47
 48. Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. ^48
 49. And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. ^49
 50. And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. ^50
 51. And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. ^51
 52. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. ^52
 53. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? ^53
 54. But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? ^54
 55. In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. ^55
 56. But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. ^56
 57. And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. ^57
 58. But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. ^58
 59. Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; ^59
 60. But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, ^60
 61. And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. ^61
 62. And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? ^62
 63. But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. ^63
 64. Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. ^64
 65. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. ^65
 66. What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. ^66
 67. Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, ^67
 68. Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? ^68
 69. Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. ^69
 70. But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. ^70
 71. And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. ^71
 72. And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. ^72
 73. And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. ^73
 74. Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. ^74
 75. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. ^75
