 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. ^1
 2. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. ^2
 3. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. ^3
 4. Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. ^4
 5. Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; ^5
 6. O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. ^6
 7. He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. ^7
 8. He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. ^8
 9. Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; ^9
 10. And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: ^10
 11. Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: ^11
 12. When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. ^12
 13. When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; ^13
 14. He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; ^14
 15. Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. ^15
 16. Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. ^16
 17. He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: ^17
 18. Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: ^18
 19. Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. ^19
 20. The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. ^20
 21. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: ^21
 22. To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. ^22
 23. Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. ^23
 24. And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. ^24
 25. He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. ^25
 26. He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. ^26
 27. They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. ^27
 28. He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. ^28
 29. He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. ^29
 30. Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. ^30
 31. He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. ^31
 32. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. ^32
 33. He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. ^33
 34. He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, ^34
 35. And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. ^35
 36. He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. ^36
 37. He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. ^37
 38. Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. ^38
 39. He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. ^39
 40. The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. ^40
 41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. ^41
 42. For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. ^42
 43. And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: ^43
 44. And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; ^44
 45. That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. ^45
