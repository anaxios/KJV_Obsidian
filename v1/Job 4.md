 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, ^1
 2. If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? ^2
 3. Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. ^3
 4. Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. ^4
 5. But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. ^5
 6. Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? ^6
 7. Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? ^7
 8. Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. ^8
 9. By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. ^9
 10. The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. ^10
 11. The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad. ^11
 12. Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof. ^12
 13. In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, ^13
 14. Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. ^14
 15. Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: ^15
 16. It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, ^16
 17. Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? ^17
 18. Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: ^18
 19. How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? ^19
 20. They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it. ^20
 21. Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom. ^21
