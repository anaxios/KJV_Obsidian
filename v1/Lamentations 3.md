 Book:: [[Lamentations]]
 1. I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. ^1
 2. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. ^2
 3. Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day. ^3
 4. My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. ^4
 5. He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. ^5
 6. He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. ^6
 7. He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. ^7
 8. Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. ^8
 9. He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. ^9
 10. He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. ^10
 11. He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. ^11
 12. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. ^12
 13. He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. ^13
 14. I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. ^14
 15. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. ^15
 16. He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. ^16
 17. And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. ^17
 18. And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: ^18
 19. Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. ^19
 20. My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. ^20
 21. This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. ^21
 22. It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. ^22
 23. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. ^23
 24. The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. ^24
 25. The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. ^25
 26. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. ^26
 27. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth. ^27
 28. He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. ^28
 29. He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. ^29
 30. He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. ^30
 31. For the LORD will not cast off for ever: ^31
 32. But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. ^32
 33. For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. ^33
 34. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth. ^34
 35. To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, ^35
 36. To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not. ^36
 37. Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? ^37
 38. Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? ^38
 39. Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? ^39
 40. Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. ^40
 41. Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. ^41
 42. We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. ^42
 43. Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. ^43
 44. Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. ^44
 45. Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. ^45
 46. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. ^46
 47. Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. ^47
 48. Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. ^48
 49. Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission. ^49
 50. Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. ^50
 51. Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. ^51
 52. Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. ^52
 53. They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. ^53
 54. Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. ^54
 55. I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. ^55
 56. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. ^56
 57. Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. ^57
 58. O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. ^58
 59. O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. ^59
 60. Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me. ^60
 61. Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me; ^61
 62. The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. ^62
 63. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. ^63
 64. Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. ^64
 65. Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. ^65
 66. Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD. ^66
