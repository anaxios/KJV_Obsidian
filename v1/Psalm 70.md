 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD. ^1
 2. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. ^2
 3. Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. ^3
 4. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. ^4
 5. But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying. ^5
