 3. Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? ^3
 4. He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. ^4
 5. He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. ^5
 6. This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. ^6
 7. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. ^7
 8. Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. ^8
 9. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. ^9
 10. Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah. ^10
