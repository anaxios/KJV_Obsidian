 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. ^1
 2. Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: ^2
 3. Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: ^3
 4. That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. ^4
 5. They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? ^5
 6. They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. ^6
 7. But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. ^7
 8. So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away. ^8
 9. And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. ^9
 10. The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory. ^10
