 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright. ^1
 2. Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. ^2
 3. Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. ^3
 4. For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. ^4
 5. He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. ^5
 6. By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. ^6
 7. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. ^7
 8. Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. ^8
 9. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. ^9
 10. The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. ^10
 11. The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. ^11
 12. Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. ^12
 13. The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. ^13
 14. From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. ^14
 15. He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. ^15
 16. There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. ^16
 17. An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. ^17
 18. Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; ^18
 19. To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. ^19
 20. Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. ^20
 21. For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. ^21
 22. Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee. ^22
