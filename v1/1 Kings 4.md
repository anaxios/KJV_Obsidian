 19. Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. ^19
 20. Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. ^20
 21. And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. ^21
 22. And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ^22
 23. Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. ^23
 24. For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. ^24
 25. And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. ^25
 26. And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. ^26
 27. And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. ^27
 28. Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. ^28
 29. And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. ^29
 30. And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. ^30
 31. For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. ^31
 32. And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. ^32
 33. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. ^33
 34. And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. ^34
