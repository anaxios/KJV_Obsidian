 Book:: [[Proverbs]]
 1. When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: ^1
 2. And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. ^2
 3. Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat. ^3
 4. Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. ^4
 5. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. ^5
 6. Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: ^6
 7. For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. ^7
 8. The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. ^8
 9. Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. ^9
 10. Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: ^10
 11. For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee. ^11
 12. Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. ^12
 13. Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. ^13
 14. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. ^14
 15. My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. ^15
 16. Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. ^16
 17. Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long. ^17
 18. For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. ^18
 19. Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. ^19
 20. Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: ^20
 21. For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. ^21
 22. Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. ^22
 23. Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. ^23
 24. The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. ^24
 25. Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. ^25
 26. My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. ^26
 27. For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit. ^27
 28. She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. ^28
 29. Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? ^29
 30. They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. ^30
 31. Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. ^31
 32. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. ^32
 33. Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. ^33
 34. Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. ^34
 35. They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. ^35
