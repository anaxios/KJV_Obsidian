 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. ^1
 2. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. ^2
 3. And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? ^3
 4. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. ^4
 5. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; ^5
 6. Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. ^6
 7. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. ^7
 8. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; ^8
 9. Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. ^9
 10. But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? ^10
 11. As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: ^11
 12. So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. ^12
 13. O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! ^13
 14. If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. ^14
 15. Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. ^15
 16. For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? ^16
 17. My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. ^17
 18. And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. ^18
 19. The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. ^19
 20. Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. ^20
 21. His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. ^21
 22. But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn. ^22
