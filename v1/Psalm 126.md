 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. ^1
 2. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. ^2
 3. The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. ^3
 4. Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. ^4
 5. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. ^5
 6. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. ^6
