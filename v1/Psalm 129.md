 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: ^1
 2. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. ^2
 3. The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. ^3
 4. The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. ^4
 5. Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. ^5
 6. Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: ^6
 7. Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. ^7
 8. Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD. ^8
