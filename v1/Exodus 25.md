 Book:: [[Exodus]]
 1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, ^1
 2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. ^2
 3. And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass, ^3
 4. And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, ^4
 5. And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, ^5
 6. Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense, ^6
 7. Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate. ^7
 8. And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. ^8
 9. According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it. ^9
 10. And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. ^10
 11. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. ^11
 12. And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. ^12
 13. And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. ^13
 14. And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. ^14
 15. The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it. ^15
 16. And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. ^16
 17. And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. ^17
 18. And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. ^18
 19. And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof. ^19
 20. And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. ^20
 21. And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. ^21
 22. And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. ^22
 23. Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. ^23
 24. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. ^24
 25. And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. ^25
 26. And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. ^26
 27. Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table. ^27
 28. And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. ^28
 29. And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them. ^29
 30. And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before me always. ^30
 31. And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same. ^31
 32. And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side: ^32
 33. Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick. ^33
 34. And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers. ^34
 35. And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick. ^35
 36. Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold. ^36
 37. And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. ^37
 38. And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. ^38
 39. Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels. ^39
 40. And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount. ^40
