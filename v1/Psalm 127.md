 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. ^1
 2. It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep. ^2
 3. Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. ^3
 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. ^4
 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. ^5
