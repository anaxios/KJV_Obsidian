 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. ^1
 2. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. ^2
 3. I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, ^3
 4. Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. ^4
 5. And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. ^5
 6. For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? ^6
 7. God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him. ^7
 8. O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? ^8
 9. Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. ^9
 10. Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. ^10
 11. The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. ^11
 12. The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. ^12
 13. Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. ^13
 14. Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. ^14
 15. Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. ^15
 16. In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. ^16
 17. For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted. ^17
 18. For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king. ^18
 19. Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. ^19
 20. I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: ^20
 21. With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him. ^21
 22. The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. ^22
 23. And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. ^23
 24. But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted. ^24
 25. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. ^25
 26. He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. ^26
 27. Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. ^27
 28. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. ^28
 29. His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. ^29
 30. If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; ^30
 31. If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; ^31
 32. Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. ^32
 33. Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. ^33
 34. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. ^34
 35. Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. ^35
 36. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. ^36
 37. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah. ^37
 38. But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. ^38
 39. Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. ^39
 40. Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. ^40
 41. All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours. ^41
 42. Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. ^42
 43. Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. ^43
 44. Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. ^44
 45. The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. ^45
 46. How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? ^46
 47. Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? ^47
 48. What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. ^48
 49. Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth? ^49
 50. Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people; ^50
 51. Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. ^51
 52. Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen. ^52
