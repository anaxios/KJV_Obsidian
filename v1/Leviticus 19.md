 Book:: [[Leviticus]]
 1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, ^1
 2. Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy. ^2
 3. Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. ^3
 4. Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God. ^4
 5. And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will. ^5
 6. It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. ^6
 7. And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted. ^7
 8. Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. ^8
 9. And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest. ^9
 10. And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God. ^10
 11. Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another. ^11
 12. And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. ^12
 13. Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. ^13
 14. Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. ^14
 15. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor. ^15
 16. Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor; I am the LORD. ^16
 17. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him. ^17
 18. Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the LORD. ^18
 19. Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come upon thee. ^19
 20. And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. ^20
 21. And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering. ^21
 22. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him. ^22
 23. And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of. ^23
 24. But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal. ^24
 25. And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God. ^25
 26. Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times. ^26
 27. Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. ^27
 28. Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD. ^28
 29. Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. ^29
 30. Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. ^30
 31. Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. ^31
 32. Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD. ^32
 33. And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him. ^33
 34. But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. ^34
 35. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. ^35
 36. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. ^36
 37. Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD. ^37
