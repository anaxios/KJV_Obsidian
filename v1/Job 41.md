 Book:: [[Job]]
 1. Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? ^1
 2. Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? ^2
 3. Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? ^3
 4. Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? ^4
 5. Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? ^5
 6. Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? ^6
 7. Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? ^7
 8. Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. ^8
 9. Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? ^9
 10. None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? ^10
 11. Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. ^11
 12. I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. ^12
 13. Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? ^13
 14. Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. ^14
 15. His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. ^15
 16. One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. ^16
 17. They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. ^17
 18. By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. ^18
 19. Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. ^19
 20. Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. ^20
 21. His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. ^21
 22. In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. ^22
 23. The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. ^23
 24. His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. ^24
 25. When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. ^25
 26. The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. ^26
 27. He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. ^27
 28. The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. ^28
 29. Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. ^29
 30. Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. ^30
 31. He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. ^31
 32. He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. ^32
 33. Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. ^33
 34. He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride. ^34
