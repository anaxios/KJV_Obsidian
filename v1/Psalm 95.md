 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. ^1
 2. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. ^2
 3. For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. ^3
 4. In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also. ^4
 5. The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. ^5
 6. O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. ^6
 7. For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, ^7
 8. Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness: ^8
 9. When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. ^9
 10. Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: ^10
 11. Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. ^11
