 Book:: [[2 Timothy]]
 1. This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. ^1
 2. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, ^2
 3. Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, ^3
 4. Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; ^4
 5. Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. ^5
 6. For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, ^6
 7. Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. ^7
 8. Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. ^8
 9. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was. ^9
 10. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, ^10
 11. Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. ^11
 12. Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. ^12
 13. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. ^13
 14. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; ^14
 15. And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. ^15
 16. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: ^16
 17. That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. ^17
