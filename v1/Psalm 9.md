 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. ^1
 2. I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. ^2
 3. When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. ^3
 4. For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. ^4
 5. Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. ^5
 6. O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. ^6
 7. But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. ^7
 8. And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. ^8
 9. The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. ^9
 10. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. ^10
 11. Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. ^11
 12. When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. ^12
 13. Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: ^13
 14. That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. ^14
 15. The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. ^15
 16. The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. ^16
 17. The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God. ^17
 18. For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. ^18
 19. Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. ^19
 20. Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah. ^20
