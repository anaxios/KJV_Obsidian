 Book:: [[Song of Solomon]]
 1. Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. ^1
 2. My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. ^2
 3. I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies. ^3
 4. Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. ^4
 5. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. ^5
 6. Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them. ^6
 7. As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. ^7
 8. There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. ^8
 9. My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. ^9
 10. Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? ^10
 11. I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded. ^11
 12. Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. ^12
 13. Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. ^13
