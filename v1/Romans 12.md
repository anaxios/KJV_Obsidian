 Book:: [[Romans]]
 1. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. ^1
 2. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. ^2
 3. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. ^3
 4. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: ^4
 5. So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. ^5
 6. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; ^6
 7. Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; ^7
 8. Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. ^8
 9. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. ^9
 10. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; ^10
 11. Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; ^11
 12. Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; ^12
 13. Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. ^13
 14. Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. ^14
 15. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. ^15
 16. Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. ^16
 17. Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. ^17
 18. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. ^18
 19. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. ^19
 20. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. ^20
 21. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. ^21
