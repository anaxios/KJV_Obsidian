 Book:: [[1 Thessalonians]]
 1. But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. ^1
 2. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. ^2
 3. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. ^3
 4. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. ^4
 5. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. ^5
 6. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. ^6
 7. For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. ^7
 8. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. ^8
 9. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, ^9
 10. Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. ^10
 11. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. ^11
 12. And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; ^12
 13. And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. ^13
 14. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. ^14
 15. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. ^15
 16. Rejoice evermore. ^16
 17. Pray without ceasing. ^17
 18. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. ^18
 19. Quench not the Spirit. ^19
 20. Despise not prophesyings. ^20
 21. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. ^21
 22. Abstain from all appearance of evil. ^22
 23. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^23
 24. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. ^24
 25. Brethren, pray for us. ^25
 26. Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. ^26
 27. I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. ^27
 28. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. ^28
